# selenium-wrapper

## Purpose

I use this as the basis for writing test web page automated tests.

## Requirements

Firefox and/or Chromium
geckodriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
chromedriver: apt-get install chromium-chromedriver OR https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

## Note
1. Selenium is finicky with browser versions. The driver and browser versions must always match
2. Currently only working / tested for Linux
